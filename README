== Class Methods
Clipboard.data(format=nil)
   Returns the data currently in the clipboard.  If +format+ is
   specified, it will attempt to retrieve the data in that format. The
   default is Clipboard::TEXT. See the 'Constants' section for
   the supported formats.
   
   If there is no data in the clipboard, then an empty string is returned.
    
   Note that this method does implicit conversions on formats with regards
   to text data. See the MSDN documentation for more details.
    
Clipboard.empty
   Empty the contents of the clipboard
    
Clipboard.format_available?(format_number)
   Returns true if 'format_number' is currently available on the clipboard,
   false otherwise.

Clipboard.format_name(format_number)
   Returns the corresponding name for the given 'format_number', or nil
   if it does not exist.

Clipboard.formats
   Returns a hash of all the current formats, with the format number as the
   key and the format name as the value for that key.

Clipboard.get_data(format=nil)
   Alias for Clipboard.data.
    
Clipboard.num_formats
    Returns the number of different data formats currently on the clipboard.
    
Clipboard.register_format(format)
   Registers the given 'format' (a String) as a clipboard format, which
   can then be used as a valid clipboard format.
	
   If a registered format with the specified name already exists, a new
   format is not registered and the return value identifies the existing
   format. This enables more than one application to copy and paste data
   using the same registered clipboard format. Note that the format name
   comparison is case-insensitive.

   Registered clipboard formats are identified by values in the range 0xC000
   through 0xFFFF.

Clipboard.set_data(data, format=nil)
   Sets the clipboard contents to the data that you specify.  You may
   optionally specify a clipboard format. The default is Clipboard::TEXT.
    
   See the 'Constants' section for a list of the supported formats.
